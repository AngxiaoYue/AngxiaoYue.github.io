## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. I am supervised by Prof. [Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree in Data Science from Beijing Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. [Dixin Luo](https://dixinluo.github.io/). My research interests focus on Machine Learning/Deep Learning driven by Geometry Algebra and AI4Science.
